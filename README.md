# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics project demonstrating a typical Data Analyst workflow using SQL, Python, and Tableau.

## Project Overview

The project simulates a realistic analytics scenario involving:

- Transforming raw data into analysis-ready tables
- Performing structured data quality checks
- Defining and computing business KPIs
- Conducting analytical validation using Python
- Supporting dashboarding and reporting

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- SQL – data preparation, transformations, validation, KPI logic
- Python – analysis, validation, and exploratory checks
- Tableau – dashboarding and visual communication

## Repository Structure

- `data/` → raw and processed data placeholders
- `sql/` → setup, quality checks, KPI queries, ad-hoc analysis
- `python/` → analysis and validation scripts
- `tableau/` → dashboard notes and screenshots
- `reports/` → executive summaries and insights
- `docs/` → data model and metric definitions

## How to Reproduce

1. Run `sql/01_setup.sql`
2. Run `sql/02_quality_checks.sql`
3. Run `sql/03_kpis.sql`
4. Run Python analysis / validation scripts in `python/`
5. Build dashboard using the outputs (see `tableau/`)
